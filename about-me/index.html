            Hi, my name is Thiago and I am a guitarist and a producer who has
            recently started my musical journey. I was originally born in Rio
            de Janeiro, Brazil but now live in New Jersey. Throughout my time
            living in the United States, I believe that music has influenced my
            way of life as I was constantly exploring the field. I would be
            listening to music on the bus, during car rides, in the halls in
            between classes, and even while just completing day to day tasks. I
            would always find myself listening to many different genres of
            Brazilian music, from jazz to funk, and even rock. And while my
            palette for my countryâ€™s music was very extensive, the same was with
            the music I listened to in the United States. I would listen to many
            of the same genres like jazz, RNB, and rock but also discover
            hip-hop and DnB as well as so many other genres. Listening to all
            these different kinds of genres and music inspired me to start
            creating myself. I thought to myself that I wanted to be able to
            create my own art and contribute to the culture. I wanted my music
            to have its own identity and world within each project. I wanted to
            always stay true to my influences, but also explore other ideas and
            concepts. Eventually, these wants turned into plans and now I am
            producing and creating as much as I can. As I continue to create I
            hope to never stop evolving, but always wear my influences by my
            sleeve.
