                This track's title is from the sample that is heard throughout
                the beat (Living In the Past by Unnatural Funk Band). The
                creation of this beat was a happy mistake as there was a
                completely different direction in mind. The original goal was to
                make a loop only using the vocals. Upon trying that I wasn’t
                very happy with the results but I then reversed the sample to
                see if I would get any varying results. As I reversed it I was
                chopping up certain segments to see if they sounded right
                together and eventually found the guitar solo in reverse. I then
                rearranged parts of the solo to create the main loop and
                foundation of this beat.

                The inspiration and soul of this beat comes directly from Rio de
                Janeiro. Tim Maia, and the movie City of God (Cidade de Deus)
                are both sampled in this project. Tim Maia’s song (Pais e
                filhos) is sampled for the first 30 seconds for an intro, and
                then transitioned into the chopped beat. The clips from the film
                can be heard in both the beginning, middle and end of the song.
                The beat features a chopped sample of Tim Maia singing “A vida e
                eso ai” which can be translated to “thats life”. I believe this
                chop represents what Rocket (the protagonist) has to go through
                throughout the film. Rocket’s situation never really changes
                from the beginning all the way until the end of the movie
                despite the events that happen. For that reason I believe these
                two samples go hand in hand together and make sense of one
                another.

                This track was to be another happy mistake as the intent of this
                song was to create a standard trap or hip hop beat but instead
                became something of a house record. Instead of adding basic trap
                dums I tried using a constant clap playing with some accent
                snares as well adding a hi-hat/brush effect to give it more
                groove. The drums I ended up using for the final take made me
                realize how much I can really expand into new genres in my own
                way. This track is one I believe would be played at some sort of
                boiler room set.

            <div class="audio-description">
                This title of the track “My ordinary life” comes from the
                show“Nichijou” and the choice of the title stemmed from the fact
                of how carefree and lighthearted the song felt. The goal on this
                track was mostly to create something jazzy and relaxing while
                also having a catchy melody and some bouncy drums. The snare’s
                and 808’s are very basic but the hi-hat pattern creates most of
                the bounce and groove found in the beat. The takeaway from this
                track was that simplicity is sometimes key.

                The rather electronic and rhythmic melody playing throughout the
                song was originally a chord progression that I thought didn’t
                have much to it. Instead of creating a different progression I
                instead started playing around with different effects one of
                them being a plug in called gross beat. The effect had many
                different options for it but it basically took and played
                whatever it was used on in a different rhythm or pattern. After
                much time of playing with the result I got one that left me more
                than satisfied. The drums heard during sections of the song can
                be heard taking influence from jersey club as well as a subgenre
                of hiphop called “jerk”.The hey and go! Vocal samples you hear
                are what i think make the beat what it is, and without it I feel
                as if the track would lose its character. The atmosphere to me
                sounded like it would be something you heard in the early 2000’s
                hence the name of the track being “blackberry phone”.

                The title of this track is in reference to the horror game
                “kuon” which was released in 2004 for the ps2. The choice of
                this name came from the danceable but uncomfortable sound of the
                track. The atmospheric pad playing in the back as well as the
                strings create an unsettling feel to the track. While the drums
                throughout feel very upbeat and bouncy I wanted to keep the
                feeling of something mischievous.

                The goal for this track was to make something very catchy and
                upbeat for the listener. The electric piano and combination of
                bells perfectly create a very relaxing and almost video-gamey
                feel to the track. I used a loud and very bitcrushed 808 to give
                that bounce and retro feel. Just like “My ordinary life” I
                believe that simplicity is what's best sometimes.

                The name of the track is to describe the exact kind of feel I
                was trying to go for in the song. The chords you hear are two
                electric pianos layered on another with one having a sort of
                delay effect. The piano combined with the many synths created a
                very space-like atmosphere.
